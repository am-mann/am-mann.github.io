Studied properties of Kemney's constant and related random walk parameters on threshold graphs. We establish explicit formulae for K(G) in terms of the construction code of a threshold graph, and completely determine the ordering of the accessibility indices of vertices in threshold graphs. I specifically focused on combinatorial approaches and proved some of the results in section 4.

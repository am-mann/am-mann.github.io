Studied Kemney's constant and related random walk parameters on a team as part of the Fields Summer Undegraduate Research Program. 

Kemeny's constant measures how fast a random walker moves around in a graph. We study Kemeny's constant for random walks on threshold graphs, and show various techniques for calculating Kemeny's constant and related random walk parameters for graphs. We establish explicit formulae for K(G) in terms of the construction code of a threshold graph, and completely determine the ordering of the accessibility indices of vertices in threshold graphs.

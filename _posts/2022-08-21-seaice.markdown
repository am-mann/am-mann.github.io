I wrote code to calculate back trajectories and forward trajectories of sea ice in the Last Ice Area using satellite velocity data with a particular interest in understanding the cause of the anomolous sea ice reversal in February 2018. I received funding from the Laidlaw Research Fellowship. In process of turning into paper.
